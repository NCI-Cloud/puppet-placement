    Defaults of the following parameters will be changed in a future release.
    Please set the parameter explicitly to keep the value during upgrade.
    Also it is likely that endpoint parameters in ``nova::keystone::auth``
    should be also updated.

    - ``placement::wsgi::apache::api_port``: from ``80`` to ``8778``
    - ``placement::wsgi::apache::path``: from ``/placement`` to ``/``
