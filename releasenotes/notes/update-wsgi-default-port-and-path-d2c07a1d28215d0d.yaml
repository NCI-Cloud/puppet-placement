    Default values of the following parameters have been changed, so that
    the consistent endpoint url is used by default. Also, default values of
    the ``placement::keystone::auth::*_url`` parameters have been updated
    accordingly.

    - ``placement::wsgi::api_port``: ``80`` to ``8787``
    - ``placement::wsgi::path``: ``/placement`` to ``/``
